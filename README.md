[Host On Replit](https://replit.com/@TopClips/Improved-Music?v=1)
> Note: If you are hosting your bot in heroku, Please consider upgrading your dyno for running dashboard & bot simultaneously because in free dyno it'll run out of memory(as there are two workers). If you want to run only the bot, turn off the `web` dyno.


## 🦋 Common Bugs
